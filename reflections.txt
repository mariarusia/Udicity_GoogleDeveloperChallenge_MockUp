  I have known a bit of web development before, but some tags were new. I have not used <figure> tag before, that was a new thing for me. <Sub> and <sup> tags were new as well. I find creating the html page quite easy, the most difficult thing being finding the right wording to type into the Google search. In this project, however, the wording was given in advance. The main strategy so far is googling. Usually the right answer is given as a feature snippet.
